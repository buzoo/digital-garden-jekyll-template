## Why Digital Gardening?

I always had thoughts/wishes about writing my own blog and sharing my ideas and learnings with everyone. Due to various reasons I would not end up starting the blog.

Around that time I came across Digital Gardening. When I first read about digital gardening I knew that this is how I wanted to organize and share my thoughts. Specifically, the idea that the 'posts' are ever-growing and need not be at a finalised state to be useful.
This is one of the major motivations for me to start this garden.

Other reasons --
- I feel I should articulate my thoughts, ideas, feelings so as to be able to better cope and manage and get things done.
- To document my process and journey which can be helpful to review and assess and improve further.
- to create a repository of learnings and resources for reference for myself and for anyone who might benefit from it.
- To be a little more vulnerable about sharing what is within me.

### What do I plan/want to grow in this garden?
- Learnings from various tasks and projects that I take up.
- Observations from my daily musings and experiences in the world.
- Trading
	- success and failures, observations and learnings in the day-to-day trading.
	- learnings from various videos, webinars, courses that I attend.
	- Data about my performance over time.
- Sahaja
	- Our thought process and evolution of the idea/concept.
	- Out trials and errors along the way.
	- All the different ideas about various aspects of the brand and business.
- Woodworking
	- mapping journey from an absolute novice to a wherever I end up reaching.
	- Exploration of form, function and design.
	- repository of inspirations, motivations, solutions, etc.
- Digital Garden
	- Why and how it started
	- How it is evolving
	- How it can help more people

may be this urge to share comes from my nature of being introverted and hence the urge to share on the internet feels safe, I guess.
