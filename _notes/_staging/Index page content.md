## Why Digital Gardening?

I have always wished about starting a blog to share my thoughts, ideas and learnings with everyone. I find it a comfortable medium to express myself.
*Due to various reasons I would not end up starting the blog.*

Some time ago I came across Digital Gardening. When I first read about it I knew that this is how I wanted to organize and share my thoughts. 
It made sense to me that my thoughts on topics need not be 'final' or absolute when I wanted to post. It gave them the liberty to explore and evolve. This way feels more natural. The posts are ever-growing seeds if taken care of and nurtured.

This is one of the major motivations for me to start this garden.
Other reasons are much more personal. I feel an urge to share/articulate/express and I tend to choose this medium because in real life I am a very reserved/introverted person. This would help me empty my mind from time to time.

What do I intend to achieve through Digital gardening?
- On objective terms :
	- to document processes and experiences(journey) in order to help with assess and review and improve.
	- to create a repository of learnings and resources for reference useful to myself and anyone else who might benefit from it.
		- ensuring that these are based not just on theory but also life-proven.
- On subjective terms :
	- ????

sidetracks---
- may be this urge to share comes from my nature of being introverted and hence the urge to share on the internet feels safe, I guess.

- although I understand how digital garden can be useful to me, I am still figuring out how to make it more useful for other readers.

- may be the section 'why i am doing digital gardening' should go into the about, not on the main page.

Other reasons --
- I feel I should articulate my thoughts, ideas, feelings so as to be able to better cope and manage and get things done.
- To document my process and journey which can be helpful to review and assess and improve further.
- to create a repository of learnings and resources for reference for myself and for anyone who might benefit from it.
- To be a little more vulnerable about sharing what is within me.
