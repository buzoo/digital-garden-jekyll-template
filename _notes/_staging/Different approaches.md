- Normal approach of reading is what the author decides at the time of writing. It assumes what the reader would be interested in and decides when and how the reader should ingest a particular sentence.

- Another approach is that the reader should have the freedom to choose what information to ingest as per their curiosity, interest, need etc. This can be guided by what questions arise in their minds while reading a particular page and accordingly they can click on the questions to get them answered.

An alternate approach that I am suggesting is a mix of both the approaches where parts of information are simply fed and other parts are open to 'exploration' by the reader.

	_In this section, give a list of questions. The answers will show when clicked on these questions. The thought process being that the reader gets to choose what they want to read and when.  
	The flow of reading is decided as per the interest or curiosity of the reader at the given moment._
