<h1 class="heading">
  Why I am doing Digital Gardening
</h1>

I have always wished about being able to share my thoughts, ideas and learnings with everyone. I find that online platforms such as blogs are a comfortable medium to express myself. However, until now I had made only unsuccessful attempts at getting a blog running.

<div>
<p class="heading para-head">motivations </p>

Some time ago I came across Digital Gardening. When I first read about it I knew that this is how I wanted to organize and share my thoughts.
It made sense to me that my thoughts on topics need not be 'final' or absolute when I wanted to post. Digital Gardening gave me the liberty to explore and evolve. This way feels more natural. The posts can be ever-growing seeds if taken care of and nurtured. This is one of the major motivations for me to start this garden.

Other reasons are more personal. I feel an urge to share/articulate/express and I tend to choose this medium because in real life I am a very reserved/introverted person. This would help me empty my mind from time to time.

          Objectively,
          <ul>
            <li>to document processes and experiences(journey) in order to help with assess and review and improve.</li>
            <li>to create a repository of learnings and resources for reference useful to myself and anyone else who might benefit from it.</li>
