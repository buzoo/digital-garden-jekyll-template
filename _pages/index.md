# Hola! ðŸŒ±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  This is my attempt at maintaining a digital garden. Through this I hope to capture my thoughts and learnings in various fields.
  <!-- Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Your first note]]</span> to get started on your exploration. -->
</p>

I have used the digital garden template from <a href ="https://maximevaillancourt.com/">Maxime Vaillancourt</a>. It is free, open-source, and [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).
